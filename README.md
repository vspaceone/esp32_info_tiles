### Setting a Layout
Layouts are set via JSON sent to `/layout` as HTTP POST requests. For example like this:
```json
{
	"solder":{"x":0,"y":0,"desc":["Alle","Lotstationen","abgek√ºhlt."], "icon":"soldering_iron"},
	"power":{"x":1,"y":0,"desc":["Strom","ist","aus."], "icon":"building_power"},
	"dishwasher":{"x":2,"y":0,"desc":["Sp\u0081lmaschine","ist","ausger\u0084umt."], "icon":"dishwasher_alert", "icon_ok":"dishwasher"},
	"fox":{"x":0,"y":1,"desc":["The quick brown","fox jumps over","the lazy dog."]},
	"windows":{"x":1,"y":1,"desc":["Die Fenster","sind","alle zu."], "icon":"window"},
	"door":{"x":2,"y":1,"desc":["Hubwagen","T\u0081r","geschlossen"], "icon":"door"}
}
```
A layout consists of a single object with each key being the name of your choice for a status-tile.
The value corresponding to that key is another object which has the `x` and `y` keys for the tiles location on the 3x2 grid,
a `desc` key for an array with three strings (character set is [CodePage437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437)), each one line of the description,
and optionally an `icon` key for a string corresponding to the name of an icon.

### Setting states
States are set via JSON sent to `/layout` as HTTP POST requests. For example like this:
```json
{"solder":"unknown","power":"on","dishwasher":"off",
"fox":"unknown","windows":"off","door":"on"}
```
For each tile that shall change state, a key-value pair has to be sent, the key being the name assigned in the layout,
and the value being a string (either `on` for OK, `off` for bad, or anything else for unknown). 

### Other
* `brighness` sets the displays brightness. (Send a number from 0 to 100 via HTTP POST.)
* `power` turns the Display on/off via DDC. (Send either `on` or `off` via HTTP POST.)
